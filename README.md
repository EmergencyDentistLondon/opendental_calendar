# opendental_calendar
Simple calendar app for Opendental written in Zend Framework 1

This is a calendar application we use at <a href="https://www.emergencydentistin.london">Emergency Dentist London</a> to let some members of our crew access the treatment calendar without having to log in to our intranet to access our dental software (Opendental).
It is written in Zend Framework 1, it is planned to be migrated to Zend Framework 3, and to be extended in the near future.

Please ask any questions, if I can I will help.
